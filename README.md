## About Me

### Bio
<b>I'm Steven.</b> I am a computer science student with many interests. I have been fascinated by technology forever and have been coding for 9 years now. I've developed simulations, web applications, video games, robotics controllers, and more. Apart from software development, my hobbies and interests include history, music, geography, political science, martial arts, video games, and soccer.


### Past
My first exploration in programming was in middle school. Starting with block and visual coding, I began writing scripts for classes and competitions and soon learned my first Python. In high school, I joined the Robotics team and became the team's lead coder in the same year, writing VEX code in C++. By senior year, I had started to learn Java and toolkits like Swing. Through my first college courses, Java became my preferred coding language, and I have continued to develop in a range of languages including Java, C and C++, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript. Most recently, I have done a lot of web app dev using Vanilla JS, Angular, and React.


### Now
I am currently an undergrad student at [Purdue University Fort Wayne](https://www.pfw.edu/). I will graduate in Spring of 2026 with a [bachelor's in Computer Science](https://www.pfw.edu/academics-research/majors-minors/computer-science-bs). In Fall of 2025, I also started earning a postgraduate degree through dual-enrollment. I hope to earn my master's degree in Computer Science in Spring of 2027. I am an honors student with a cumulative GPA of 3.75.
